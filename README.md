[Draw a box](https://drawabox.com/) is an online drawing course I started during some time off. Although I'm back
working full time and this course may take me a long time to complete, I'd really like to give it a good go. I'm 
posting my homework here so it can be critiqued and although I know it's not the point of the course, because I'd like
to be able to look back and see how much I've learned along the way.
